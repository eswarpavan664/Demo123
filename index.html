        <p> presentation of Swami Vivekananda's Message of strength and
             fearlessness by the resident swami of the Vedanta Society of New
              York. Vivekananda's stirring words roused not only the nation of
               India, but many in the west who were glad to see that religion could
                be uplifting in one's personal life. As Swami Vivekananda said, Stand on 
            your own feet...Think your own thoughts. Strength is religion."</p>

                 and a vision. These are the foundations that will empower you to embark on the
                  journey to change your life.</p>

                    <p>Anne Morrow Lindbergh took the world by storm with her miniature but massively powerful 1955 memoir, 
                        The Gift from The Sea. As she muses on a short break from motherhood and society’s growing 
                        technologies while on an ocean-view vacation, readers get an intimate look into Morrow Lindbergh’s 
                        thoughts as she tries to slow down to a mindful state. And since she thinks brilliantly in metaphor,
                         you’re in for a treat — from seashells to the flow of the tides, get ready for new connections
                         and ideas that you simply won’t find in modern self-help books. </p>
